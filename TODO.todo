* How to handle overlaps
** Algorithmically
*** Each column has ranges of times when it is occupied
*** Fill the first unoccupied column, or add a new one
** Graphically
** Give every <td> an appropriate class like ".monday" etc
** To insert a new table column, $(".monday").after() or some such

* How to handle times outside the normal
** Using a table
*** Work with half-hour blocks
*** Merge blocks as needed (this might be hard? I'll need to delete the block below it if necessary)
    The table will be write-once, and recreated every time by scratch
    So this isn't a huge concern perhaps
*** Create a data structure in Schedule which is a set of columns. Then read off that data structure to create the table
